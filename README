This directory contains source files for Scam, an interpreter for a toy language
that is similar to a subset of Scheme. It is written in Orson, and is intended
to run under Unix-like systems, such as GNU/Linux. Scam was written to test the
Orson library’s garbage collector, signal handler, and Unicode character
methods. The files in the scam/ directory contain Orson source code for the Scam
interpreter. The allegedly interesting ones are marked with ‘✗’.
