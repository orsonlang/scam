This  directory  contains source  files  for Scam,  an  interpreter  for a  toy
language that is similar to a subset  of Scheme. It is written in Orson, and is
intended to run under Unix-like systems, such as GNU/Linux. Scam was written to
test  the  Orson  library’s  garbage  collector, signal  handler,  and  Unicode
character  methods.  These  files  contain  Orson  source  code  for  the  Scam
interpreter. The allegedly interesting ones are marked with ‘✗’.
